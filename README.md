# :heart:Project tech matching app:fork_and_knife:
~Name app~ is a matching application where users can match with restaurants. Users can create an account, fill in their preferences and set filters. Then the app shows a list of restaurants that meet the user's wishes and the user can start swiping the cards left and right. All restaurants that the user swiped to the right will appear in the favorites list, where the user can chat with the restaurant or place a reservation immediately.

I have chosen to focus on the functionality where the user can swipe the cards and save the favorites in a favorites list.
